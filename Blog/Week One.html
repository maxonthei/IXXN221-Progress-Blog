    <h1> July 18th - July 22nd </h1>
   <p> This Week we went over more about what is expected from us in this course and further details about the assesments. 
        We learnt about user personas and did a task around creating one for spongebob. We also contuined this into creating an empathy map. I also watched the second video on HTML basics.
        <br> <br> 
        Creaing empathy maps is very important for web design because it helps us understand how people tick and what user interface would mesh well with them.
        It infulences me as a disinger by helping me think more about people on an induvidual level and how to cater for diffrent types of personalites. </p>
