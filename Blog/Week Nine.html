    <h1> September 12th - September 16th</h1>
    <p> In class we did a draft presentation to get general feedback. The only feedback I got was to make sure I had better alingment in my block wireframe. After I left class I worked on that.
        Wensday and Thursday was dedicated to finishing up my PC hi-fi prototype as well as creting my hi-fi mobile one. To achive this I just copied the lo-fi file and changed the colours and some of the layout. 
        I also worte my design commentary and compiled all the work I had done into one doc so that I was ready for presentation.
