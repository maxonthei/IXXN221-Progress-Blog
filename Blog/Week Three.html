    <h1> August 1st - August 5th </h1>
    <p>This week we continued to go over what was expected of us for our assesment. This included learning about customer journey maps and user flow. We did an exersise mapping these out using Spongebob as our actor. 
        After that we did a coding exersize going over what we learnt in the week 3 video which inclued margins, boarders and padding of text and images.
        <br> <br> 
        In my own time I also compiled all the work I had done on assesment one into one doctument and sent it to Shiv for feedback.
        I also watched the coding video on flexboxes.
