    <h1> August 8th - August 14th </h1>
    <p> Monday's class was geared towards one on one assignment help. We spent the majority of class getting ready for hand in and I quitely worked on my progect by myself, refining the details and bringing it to a higher quality. 
        There was no coding exsersize but the weekly quiz was on divs and flexboxes in relation to the vstream video.
        <br> <br>
        On Tuseday I watched the week 5 coding video on grids and contuined to polish up my assesment one making small edits to the wording and presentation. </p>
