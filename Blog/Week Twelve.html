    <h1> October 2nd - October 7th</h1>
    <p>On Monday after class I worked on my blog layout, attempting to implament a grid so that I could have a header and a home button. I ended up disgarding the header but kept the home button.
        On Tuseday I began expanding on what I had written in my blog and also went over my Editor X design to see what needed to be expanded on, refrencing my figma design to make sure they matched up.
