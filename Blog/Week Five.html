    <h1> August 15th - August 19th</h1>
    <p>In class on Monday we presented our progect ones and were introduced to progect two. On Tuseday I began sketching out wireframs for my website design.
        I was mostly focused on what features I wanted to be in the design and was also giving basic consideration to layout and navigation. 
        While doing this I refrenced other websites such as goodreads to help me get an idea of what users were familiar with. I also thought more about what features 
        I wanted in my website, coming up with the more solid idea of groups where people can discuss books. I started coming up with a name for a website 
        going through several ideas such as 'Book Swap,' 'Book Barter' and 'Read n Replace' before eventually settling on BookCycle
