    <h1>September 22nd - September 26th</h1>
    <p> On Tuseday I started putting my sketches into figma, changing small details along the way as I found they didn't really work. I got the majortiy of the website mocked up and prototyped and started to really see how it all came togeather.
        <br> <br>
        On Wensday I started tidying up the prototype and finished adding all of the features. I had run into a thought surounding the task bar and so I asked my friends what they expected when they click a logo in a top left corner and how they would 
        feel if they were not taken to a home page. After getting their feedback I edited my logo a little and ended up moving it into the search bar and then added the typical hamburger menu icon. After making sure all the interactions worked I shared the 
        finished prototype with my friends for feedback. They said it was nice and easy to navigate and one friend said the dropdown menu should be smaller. They also pointed out some of my spelling mistakes and said a few of my alignments were off.
        <br> <br>
        Later when my mother was home from work I got her to test the prototype. The biggest note she made was she watned a back arrow. When I asked her what she thought the website was for she got it entirely correct except she thought the bok swapping was 
        for ebooks. We discussed that it might not be viable to swap ebooks but came up with the idea that in your profiles libray it would have a note as to weather you own it in physical for digatal form, but ebooks are not avalible for swapping. On Thursday 
        I updated a few viusal details and added more pages to the group section</p>
