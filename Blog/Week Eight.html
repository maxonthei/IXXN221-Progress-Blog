    On Tuseday I began work on the identity system for my website. I figured out what colours and fonts I wanted to use and also compiled and edited some of the iconography.
        The main colour I went for was green and white. Green to make an assosiation with recycling and white as a contrast/background colour. I used multiple shades of green to use in diffrent areas. 
        The iconofraphy I used was ones that are very similar to the stuff that you find on other sites, inluding things like a notificaton button and stars for the rating system.

        On Wensday and Thursday I began designing my Hi Fi prototype, updating some of the style from my lofi one along the way and deciding what colouration goes where.
        The foucs here was really thinking about what would look go to a casual user of the internet. What was pleasing to the eye and what was easy to read and navigate.</p>
