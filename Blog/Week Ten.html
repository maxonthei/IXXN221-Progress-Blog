    <h1> September 19th - September 23rd </h1>
    <p> In class on Monday we did presentations for progect 2-1 and were introduced to project 2-2. Throughout the rest of the week I began implamenting my figma design into EditorX.
        I had some trouble with this because Editor X wasn't very responcive or intuative. I often found it diffcult to move pictures and text and lay them out where I wanted.
        This resulted in a slow start for this part of the project and much frustration. Despite my roadblocks I tried my best to make it work all while making sure it matched up to my figma design.
